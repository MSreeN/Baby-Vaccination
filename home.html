          The <span class="hero-description-highlight">CDCâ€™s recommended schedule (Birth through 6 years old)</span> is the ONLY vaccination schedule in the U.S. that is rigorously tested for safety and effectiveness.  This same schedule is also recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).
